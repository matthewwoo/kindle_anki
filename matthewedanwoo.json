Ads.\n\nMP Partnership reached out to me last week to ask if Jane.com could be part of any testing that could help improve the distribution and traffic to their MP listings. However, when I investigated further I found out that Jane.com is also an advertiser that your team planned to reach out to test ROAS performance. \n\nGiven that in both test, we are using Instant Checkout Ads but for different use cases:\n1. Drive traffic to MP listings (prospecting)\n2. Drive better ROAS (retargeting)\n\nFrom my POV, given the two different use cases  I think it should be fine to run 2 separate split tests one for prospecting and the other retargeting. \n\nThere's an internal meeting that we are having to discuss how we should position the test to Jane.com tomorrow that I'll invite you to, but wanted to give you a heads up and get your thoughts first :)

engagement shoot, we'll keep you posted on that and reach out if we can make it out early to Italy prior to the wedding. One question on this is if we happen to be in another nearby country (i.e. Paris), would you be open to flying over and what would the additional expense for that? Thanks! \n\n**Videographer**\nRegarding the videographer, do you plan to work with him soon? We would like to see a sample of a video where you work with him before we make a decision. \n\n**Next Steps**\nIn terms of next steps: \n**1. Contract** - If you could send the contract we can review it and the return it to you signed. \n**2.

C2C Boosted Listings AA is up 37%+ m/m and Revenue is up 38% m/m  across all segments we have recovered and surpassed from Pre-COVID AA - 311K vs. 329K and Revenue - $140K vs. $114K\n2. B2C Boosted Listings grew AA from 63 to 94, as dealers like Asbury and BHA increase spend due to strong performance, and new dealership groups onboard like Sonic. However our CPV is up 100% m/m and CPL is up 165% m/m, that being said it's inline with Pre-COVID levels of $13.97, and is still outperforming AIA ($11.25 vs. $38.50). \n  - Another potential factor is our recent category relevancy filter launch that increased CPV by 27%, we have since rolled back and plan to relaunch once we find levers to mitigate this increase, two potential levers is: \n  - Search Placement - ~8% reduction\n  - Page Type Migration (feature for Ads delivery model) - ~10% reduction\n3. MP is shifting their Ecomm strategy to C2C Shipped and as a result we will no longer be focused on expanding to that vertical. Instead the team will double down C2C Shipped and focus on improving ad performance (currently 0 LI is at 60% vs. 25% (overall boosted listing)) and expand our offering to better meet their needs. \n\nLooking forward the themes we are focused in H2 2020 is to:\n1. Ladder Up to focus on monetizer / c2c shipped - performance, catalog boosting, etc...\n2. Driving growth in classifieds - with a strong focus on Motors\n3. Incubate new bets - Live Shopping\n4. Invest in onsite commerce ads foundation - Ad delivery & ranking improvements\n\nWe are finalizing our roadmap and opportunity landscape soon, and will share when available.\n\nFinally, Zander Chase has been making some great progress on a [seller segment snapshot dashboard](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/unidash/dashboard/boosted_listings/seller_segment_snapshot/?events=%7B%22289017108888568%22%3A%7B%22289017108888568%22%3A%7B%22data%22%3A%222020-05-31%22%2C%22publisher_id%22%3A%22289017108888568%22%7D%2C%22select_date%22%3A%7B%22data%22%3A%222020-05-31%22%2C%22publisher_id%22%3A%22289017108888568%22%7D%7D%2C%22551394228856825%22%3A%7B%22551394228856825%22%3A%7B%22data%22%3A[%22__ALL__%22]%2C%22publisher_id%22%3A%22551394228856825%22%7D%2C%22select_country%22%3A%7B%22data%22%3A[%22__ALL__%22]%2C%22publisher_id%22%3A%22551394228856825%22%7D%7D%7D) where we can track this automatically, look forward to that coming soon!\n\n__Note: Pre/post COVID-19 date is March 9th, 2020__","create-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com","create-time":1592253236319,"uid":"wLMVdSRIb","edit-time":1592432983923,"edit-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com"},{"string":"","create-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com","create-time":1592253424812,"uid":"4V8onUJsV","edit-time":1592253424812,"edit-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com"}],"edit-time":1589743492892,"edit-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com"},{"create-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com","create-time":1589744597533,"title":"Skydio","edit-time":1589744597534,"edit-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com"},{"create-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com","create-time":1589745003422,"title":"Woo Grandparents","edit-time":1589745003423,"edit-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com"},{"create-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com","create-time":1589771616564,"title":"Mike Murphy","edit-time":1589771616566,"edit-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com"},{"create-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com","create-time":1589771819523,"title":"August 7th, 2021","edit-time":1589771819532,"edit-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com"},{"create-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com","create-time":1589772598625,"title":"Amazon to the Rescue of the Fashion World!

By contrast, Anki's ever-expanding review intervals quickly rise past a month and then out past a year. Indeed, for my personal set of Anki cards the average interval between reviews is currently 1.2 years, and rising. In an below I estimate that for an average card, I'll only need 4 to 7 minutes of total review time over the entire 20 years. Those estimates allow for occasional failed reviews, resetting the time interval.

Reaching out to see if you would be interested in being part of a group of product alumni to help Ivey become the top undergraduate program for product management (see below for TLDR)\n\nI've already gotten the sign-off from the Head of Alumni Network, and will be presenting this proposal to Career Management and eventually the Dean Sharon Hodgson.\n\nI'm currently working with two other product alumni (Colin Lernell, Senior Director of Product at Udacity, Anirduha Nandi, APM at Uber ), if this sounds interesting to you are you free a quick chat this Friday at 1:00pm? \n\nCheers, \nMatt\n\nTLDR;\nProduct management is an increasingly important role within the technology industry, the CEOs of leading technology firms like Google, Microsoft and Yahoo were all previously product managers.The top MBA programs (HBA, GSB, Wharton) recognize this trend and are adapting by offering PM specific programs. However there is no institution offering the same education for undergraduates.\n\nIvey has the opportunity to become the first undergraduate program globally that top tech companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft come for Product Management recruitment. We are well positioned for this because 1) there is an increasing number of students who are interested in product management (+50% YoY increase in comp sci dual degrees) 2) tech firms are already starting to take notice (i.e. Microsoft recruited 5 interns, and 5 full time PMs in 2019) and 3) we have a strong alumni network within the top tech firms (see here).\n\nBy 2022 we want to 1) establish a pipeline where the top 10 tech firms host on-site campus recruitment at Ivey 2) coach & prepare students so that every year 20 of them will receive offers and 3) work with Ivey professors to integrate product management into the curriculum through 5 Product Management Consulting Projects, and 2 Product Management Cases.\n\nWith your support, we can help Ivey take this opportunity to extend its leadership and presence within tech.\n","create-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com","create-time":1592322491790,"uid":"wnvSdvsXF","edit-time":1592322871390,"edit-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com"}],"uid":"OgMo2FbKm","edit-time":1592323459848,"edit-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com"},{"string":"((v729cL4Zd))","uid":"K2RgxmY5V","edit-time":1592230067891,"edit-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com"},{"string":"{{[[DONE]]}} Do the Oculus HW #canceled","create-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com","create-time":1591900518913,"children":[{"string":"Hi [@everyone](https://fb.workplace.com/chat/t/2383427811761200#)!!","uid":"DfDiFQWOQ","edit-time":1591912762625,"edit-email":"matthew.edan.woo@gmail.com"},{"string":"Oculus Superuser Homework 6/11 -
