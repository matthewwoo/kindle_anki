    <div class='noteText'>Pick the right battles to fight . Use your energy intelligently . It’s rarely wise to open
        with something contentious , controversial , or debatable . Instead , present a compelling context for change
        that is a generally accepted truth . Focus on what everybody wants . What will create a natural momentum of yes
        ? In the next chapter , I’ll talk about how to humanize your big idea . Focus on what’s right instead of on
        what’s wrong . Why put people into a fight / flight / freeze ( cortisol ) state ? You want the context for
        change to be aspirational , filled with an opportunity statement that is exciting . Otherwise , you risk your
        audience taking your message personally and interpreting that you are suggesting they are wrong , bad , or
        stupid . Putting your audience on the defensive is not a winning persuasive proposition . Avoid the seven -
        layer burrito . It may sound delicious , until you’re about three bites in and your stomach starts to turn .
        Don’t make your opening so complex that it gives your audience indigestion . Focus on a clear premise . What is
        the most dramatic and compelling way that the world is changing ? Explain it in a way that makes what you’re
        doing more obvious than ever before . It’s ideally a single idea , with at most two or three supporting points .
        Don’t get ahead of the story . Remember you live and breathe what you’re working on . Which means you might
        already be in Chapter 9 of the story , when most of your audience is back in Chapter 2 or 3 . Which is why you
        want to frame the context properly , and invite the audience to come along the journey with you . What might be
        blatantly obvious to you is what everyone most wants or needs to know . Take the time to slow down . Odds are
        people need to be reminded of the bigger picture , even if it seems rather self - evident to you .</h3>
